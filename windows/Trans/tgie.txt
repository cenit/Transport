About this GUI Input Editor for Transport and Turtle:
=====================================================

(First simpler version created in March 1997 by Urs Rohrer, PSI)
(Revised several times in November 1999 by Urs Rohrer, PSI)
(Updated in May 2002 by Urs Rohrer, PSI)

   This program has been designed mainly for new users, who are not
yet very familiar with the structure of a Transport or Turtle input
file. It helps to work with the different Transport and Turtle type
codes and parameters because their names are displayed. All push buttons
have tool tips, giving some more information about what they are doing.
All element lines are listed in an "owner-drawn extended multiple-
selection list box". When starting up the program, then the current
FOR001.DAT file is read in. By default the listed elements are printed
in "long" standard form. In case the "short" button in the "View in
List-box" section is pressed, then only function name and label
(if any) on each line are displayed. In both cases at the beginning
of each line a 15 pixel x 15 pixel bitmap (16 colors) is symbolizing
the function of the element line. If the large fonts feature in the
setup of your graphic card is being used, then bitmaps of 19 pixels
x 19 pixels are used. For better readability all text in the list
boxes is displayed with the fixed pitch system font.

There are 3 ways to edit an element (single line):
--------------------------------------------------
1) Double-click the line with the left mouse button.
2) Click at the line with the left mouse button and press the "Edit"
   button afterwards.
3) Click at the line with the left mouse button first and then with
   the right mouse button.

with 1):       You get always a simple "whole-line" edit-box.
               (Also here the font has a fixed pitch.)
with 2) or 3): For all known type codes you will get a special
               edit-box, where each parameter may be changed
               individually. (Empty parameter fields will not
               be included into the element line after pressing
               the OK button.)
Point 3)       works only with the Windows 95/98/NT4/2000 version.

Read- / Save-button features:
-----------------------------
- Read-button only:
   Current FOR001.DAT (Transport/Turtle input file) is read in an displayed.
- Read-button with Ctrl-key pressed down:
   Current FOR001.BAK (generated with last save) is read in an displayed.
- Read-button with Alt-key pressed down:
   A file dialog box is displayed for choosing the file which has to be read in.
- Save-button only:
   Content of list box is saved as FOR001.DAT.
   Old FOR001.DAT is saved as FOR001.BAK.
   Old FOR001.BAK is saved as FOR001.BK2.
- Save-button with Alt-key pressed down:
   A file dialog box is displayed for choosing the file name under which
   to save the current content of the list box.

Multiple line features for Move Up/Down, Delete, Copy and Paste:
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you keep the Ctrl-key down while clicking with the left mouse
key at different lines or drag the mouse pointer with the left
mouse key pressed down over a range of several lines, then they
are all getting selected. If you press now one of the above
mentioned buttons, then the following happens:

- Move Down: All selected lines are moved up 1 position.
             Selection remains.
- Move Up:   All selected lines are moved down 1 position.
             Selection remains.
- Delete:    All selected lines are deleted and stored in the
             paste buffer. The next line before or after is selected.
- Copy:      All selected lines are copied into the paste buffer.
             The last line only remains selected.
- Paste:     All lines in the paste buffer are inserted before/
             after the selected line.
- Also the multi-line edit box which pops up after pressing the
  Insert button offers the possibility to enter several arbitrary
  lines at once. Line separation cannot be done with the Enter
  key. Instead the Control key has to be pressed together with
  the Enter key.
- After having selected a contiguous or non-contiguous range of
  lines and then pressing the Edit button or the right mouse
  button, the selected bunch of lines may be edited simultaneously
  in a multi-line edit box.
 
Known Transport type codes for this editor are 1 to 25 and 50.
Known Turtle type codes for this editor are 1 to 7, 9, 12 to 21
26, 27, 29, 30, 50 to 53 and 60.

- If a " 16. 14. ; " element line is encountered, then "Update" is
  replaced by "Slit" for the whole scope of the Transport input file.
- If a " 13. 48. ; " element line is encountered, then for all
  bending magnets the meaning of the second parameter is angle
  instead of field value for the whole scope of the Transport
  input file.
- if a " 16. 165. ; " element line is encountered, then all  following
  type code 1. elements preceding a drift and following a slit are
  interpreted as multiple scattering parameter cards for the whole
  scope of the Turtle file.

If one of the above element line sequences are newly inserted
with this editor into the input file, then you have to press "Save"
and thereafter "Read" in order to make them active for this editor. 
If one of the above mentioned element lines is removed, then you
have to proceed the same way as well.

If you want to transform an input from Turtle to Transport or
vice versa then you have to start with interchanging the first
indicator by the number of rays or vice versa and then you have
to press "Save" and afterwards "Read" in order to establish fully
the new context.

Pressing the "New" button will not give a clean List Box field
but a short Transport or Turtle input file with one empty fit
sequence for Transport. 

If a type code 13, 15 or 16 element is edited with the special edit-box,
and if clicked with the left or right mouse button at the name of the
first parameter (marked with an asterisks [*] and a frame around it),
then an edit box containing all known possibilities for the parameter
of this very type code will be shown. The content of these edit boxes
is depending on whether the input is for Turtle or Transport. Its
content you may also print or dump to clipboard or to a file via one of
the extended system menu commands. In case the "short" button in the
"View in List-box" section is pressed, then the 13, 15 and 16 element's
functions are described in a few words depending on their meaning they
have in Turtle or Transport.

note 1:
-------
Finding out if an input file is for Turtle or for Transport is done
by analyzing the first 5 lines: If a single number on one of these
lines is less than or equal to zero, then this number is a fit indicator
and therefore the input file is for Transport. If this single number is
greater than zero, then it represents a number of rays and therefore the
input file is for Turtle.
                               -------------

note 2:
-------
If you encounter problems with this program and you would like to
have them solved, please do not hesitate to contact Urs.Rohrer@psi.ch
Please include the input files(s) and a short description of the
problem into your mail message.  Hints for improvements are also
appreciated.

Annotations for the Transport user unfamiliar with this version:
================================================================

A Transport input file (always copy it to FOR001.DAT when it has to be
used) has the following basic structure:

/title of the basic sequence/
0
.
beam line data
.
SENTINEL
/title of the first fit sequence/
-1
.
fit data
.
SENTINEL
.
.
/*PLOT* title of the last fit sequence/
-1
.
fit data
.
SENTINEL
SENTINEL

- The last title card must have a *PLOT* at the beginning. So if there
  is no fit sequence, *PLOT* must be at the beginning of the title card
  of the basic sequence.
- The indicator -1 may be replaced by -9 for deactivating this fit
  sequence.

If you look at the delivered sample input codes, then you will see, that
all of them obey this rule. If you want to look at one of this samples
with TGIE, then you first have to copy the picked one to FOR001.DAT with
the copy tool connected to the 2nd button of the task bar of the Transport
framework panel. Now when you start TGIE32.EXE (GUI-editor) it will load
and display this file. It shows you even at the top right position, that
it loaded the current FOR001.DAT file. You may now make some modifications
with the built-in tools and press the SAVE button to write the internal
data back to the external FOR001.DAT file. Also this is indicated to you
at the right top side of the GUI-editor's panel. Now you may run Transport
with the modified input data (stored in FOR001.DAT as input for Transport).
If you modify FOR001.DAT besides with some other tool and you want to
import these modifications into TGIE, then you have to press the READ
button. Also this is signaled to you at the right top message line in the
TGIE panel.

If you press the NEW button, then you are asked if you would like to have
the currently stored data overwritten by a minimal Transport input
(template for a short basic and one empty fit sequence). If you agree,
then the template is displayed. You may then add some more elements
according to your needs. If you want to test this new input, then you
have to save it to FOR001.DAT with the SAVE button. Afterwards you have
to run Transport.
